Name: James Guerra

Hobbies: I enjoy playing video games, reading and writing.  
When not working, hiking and going to the beach are pastimes that keep me occupied.  

Interests: In addition to the obvious interest in computers and computer science,
I was recently a Phd. candidate in sociology and although I have left that field 
I remain connected to my former peers and up to date on the latest research.   

<<<<<<< HEAD
Education: I received my BA in Sociology from Stony Brook University in 2012, then attended the CUNY Graduate
Center as a phd. candidate before withdrawing from that program to study computer science here at 
Oregon State University.  
  
Programming Background:
=======
Programming Background: My previous experience with programming was mostly in High School,
where I was the lead programmer of the school's robotics team, which made me familiar with C++ and Java. 
I found that introduction to programming and engineering in general to be an incredible experience 
and that was my original major when I went to college.  Despite focusing on sociology I continued 
to learn more about programming in various languages and followed developments in that field. 
As a graduate student I became familiar with R and a bit of python used by my professor's in their research.
Last semester in CS 165 my favourite program was our final project, where we created a Library database 
that kept track of various library items and patrons.  It was fun and engaging to create a program that 
had such an obvious use, and was complex in its operation behind the scenes, ie using pointers to transverse 
lists and keep track of things like fines for individual patrons.
