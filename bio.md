Name: James Guerra

Hobbies: I enjoy playing video games, reading and writing.  
When not working, hiking and going to the beach are pastimes that keep me occupied.  

Interests: In addition to the obvious interest in computers and computer science,
I was recently a Phd. candidate in sociology and although I have left that field 
I remain connected to my former peers and up to date on the latest research.   

Education: I received my BA in Sociology from Stony Brook University in 2012, then attended the CUNY Graduate
Center as a phd. candidate before withdrawing from that program to study computer science here at 
Oregon State University.  

Secret ambition: To see the NY Jets win the Super Bowl!
