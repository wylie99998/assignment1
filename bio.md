Name: James Guerra

Hobbies: I enjoy playing video games, reading and writing.  
When not working, hiking and going to the beach are pastimes that keep me occupied.  

Interests: In addition to the obvious interest in computers and computer science,
I was recently a Phd. candidate in sociology and although I have left that field 
I remain connected to my former peers and up to date on the latest research.   

Programming Background: My previous experience with programming was mostly in High School,
where I was the lead programmer of the school's robotics team, which made me familiar with C++ and Java. 
I found that introduction to programming and engineering in general to be an incredible experience 
and that was my original major when I went to college.  Despite focusing on sociology I continued 
to learn more about programming in various languages and followed developments in that field. 
As a graduate student I became familiar with R and a bit of python used by my professor's in their research.
